# Todosapp 5.5

This project the implementation of the CRUD usage of Laravel on version 5.5. CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. Coding a todo list app is a perfect exercise to be familiar with it. Building it involves ranges of concepts and techniques such as php in MVC, routing, database querying. It is also wrapped with Bootstrap CSS on top for a better visual experience.

# What have I learn

One of the most important aspects of the Laravel framework is the MVC design. With this modern framework, standardized code structure can be established such as code responsibility separation, RESTful design, etc. Even with my previous knowledge of php, building this project is completely new to me. Since I have very little knowledge about MVC, coding with MVC in mind is the major mission in the whole project. Controllers are made good used of, and same goes for routing and database control. Following such design pattern helps me collaborate better with today's developers.
